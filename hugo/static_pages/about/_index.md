ML Anthology is a unified proceedings platform for machine learning research, inspired by the [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org). It aggregates metadata from major ML conferences and journals into a single searchable site with human-readable citation keys. We provide clean metadata, citation export, and permanent links. PDFs and supplementary materials are linked to their original sources.

Each paper gets a human-readable Bibtex key in the format lastname2024venue-keyword (e.g. vaswani2017neurips-attention). This key doubles as the paper's URL on this site. Paper URLs follow the pattern /venue/year/bibtexkey and are deterministic from the paper's metadata. Every prefix is a valid page; /icml/ takes you to the latest indexed ICML year, /icml/2024/ lists all papers for that year.
