## Data We Collect

Your name, your co-authors (we know who your friends are), your publication history (we know how productive you are), your venue preferences (we know if you're a NeurIPS person or an ICML person), and your abstracts (we've read your promises about future work and we know you didn't follow through).

## Cookies

None. This is a static site.

## Data We Share

Everything. It's published research. That's the whole point.

## Your Rights

You have the right to access your data. It's on the website.

You have the right to rectification. Submit a correction to the publisher of the paper.

You have the right to erasure. Retract your paper through the original venue and we'll remove it, but we both know you won't because it has 200 citations and three of them are self-citations.

## Data Retention

Forever. That's what an anthology means.
